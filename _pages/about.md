Hello!
======
I'm Dipayan Bhattacharya, a clinical psychology researcher with a particular passion for sports psychology. I ahve completed my MA in Clinical Psychology from Banaras Hindu University with distinction (CGPA 8.5/10), I am experienced in using my academic training with practical research experience in psychological assessment and behavioral studies.

Research Experience
======
My research journey through my BA and MA degrees has led me to explore diverse areas of psychology, from conducting comprehensive well-being studies of educational staff to analyzing motivational patterns in experimental settings. My dissertation is a detailed report of my work on "Assessment of Psychological well-being, Work Motivation and mindfulness among Teaching & Non-Teaching Employee in Academic sector". Feel free to explore my other projects, dissertation, including my studies on psychological well-being and employee motivation at the [Projects](https://dipayanbhattachary2000.github.io/publications) tab. I'm also proud of my certification in sports psychology, where I achieved a 99% score in an assessment by NPTEL, which is an example of how I combine my interests with my expertise.

Work Experience
======
I have been a Human Resources Intern at Steel Infra Solutions (SISCOL) and have managed recruitment process and talent acquisition, conducted financial and safety induction programs for the duration of the internship. I have also written for blogs as a side project for experience.

My Interests
======
My connection to sports runs deep - from competing in archery at the national level to maintaining an active involvement in fitness, cricket, quizzes, and other competitive sports since secondary school. This personal background, combined with my academic expertise in psychology, strengthens my ambition to work with sports teams, athletes, and public figures to enhance their mental performance and well-being.

What I am looking for
======
I'm actively seeking PhD positions and research associate roles in psychology, with a special interest in sports psychology opportunities - whether in academic research or industry applications. My background in both clinical assessment and experimental research, combined with my multilingual capabilities (English, Hindi, Bengali) and strong analytical skills, positions me to contribute meaningfully to research teams and sports organizations alike.
